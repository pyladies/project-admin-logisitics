# Register a Previously Unregistered PyLadies Chapter

Please fill in the following form if you're organizers of an existing local PyLadies group, but
the chapter has not been registered with us. For example, if your chapter does not have its own
`{chapter}@pyladies.com`.

After you fill in this form, we can create your chapter's email address, however we ask that
you start conducting all of your PyLadies-related activities using this email address.

For example, you may need to change the email address from your meetup and social media's accounts
from a personal email address to the pyladies.com email address.

Once registered, organizers will be automatically added to our chapter organizers directory at 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14--69LWAGhF_DA8iPGRAOoh7GMJ3qFmcMQwASWqPo54/edit?usp=sharing.
As a registered organizer, you will be access this document using your `{chapter}@pyladies.com` credentials.

Registration is reviewed once per month.
